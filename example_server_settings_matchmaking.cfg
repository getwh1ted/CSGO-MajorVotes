Clients can connect without having the logos (It just looks ugly). Clients might have issues downloading them from the server (If you use a download manager plugin or similar) due to "sv_allowdownload" and "cl_allowdownload" ("sv_allowdownload" is server side downloading from clients for afaik there is a bug where it also controls downloading for clients so clients have to set it to 1)
